                Space Shooter is a local 2D co-op top-down shooter which involves a fleet of starships who must team
                up to help transport the vulcan peace negotiator Mr Spock to Romulus to help broker a peace treaty with
                Starfleet and the Romulan empire. Featuring up to 2 player local co-op, you won't have to fight the
                Romulan Republican Force enemies alone! Each player can choose their own spaceship with unique abilities and weapons

            <h5 class="w3-padding-32">
                Up 2 players can play at once in local co-op, where both players use the keyboard. Player 1 uses the W, A, S, D keys to move and Spacebar to attack in the direction they are facing.
                Player 2 uses the Arrow keys on the NumPad to move and 0 on the NumPad to attack. As the player(s) progress through the spaceGame the enemy and boss ships on the screen will start to appear more frequently, therefore the player(s) is only required to judge the timing of their shots in front of the respawning ships.
                If the player(s) misjudges the timing of their shot or crashes into the enemy after three lives, there ship will be destroyed. The player(s) will have to start from the beginning if after three lives have been lost.
                To win the spaceGame you must defeat the Romulan Republican Force enemies and get Mr Spock safely to Romulus to broker the peace treaty between the Federation and the Romulan Empire!

            <h5 class="w3-padding-30">
                The art and style concept for this spaceGame is mainly inspired by other space shooters games. To make a fresh new spaceGame, the spaceGame Star Trek Bride Crew and No Man's Sky is also one of the inspirations for the trading part.
                Every travel between planets correspond to a level. As the player progresses, the distance between the planets increases, and the spawning of hostile spaceships too. The degree of difficulty between each level will be chosen by the player before each journey.

            <h1>Level Design</h1>
            <h5 class="w3-padding-32">
                The level design topology for this spaceGame is linear, such that the players must traverse from a start to a finish avoiding obstacles along the way.
                During each level, the player will meet other spaceships which are going on the same way, and on the opposite direction. Sometimes the AI will be passive, and sometimes aggressive. It will be important to identify hostile spacecraft very quickly in order to be well prepared to fight them. For the passive ones, the player will be able to engage in a fight against them anyway.

                        This spaceGame has been developed using JavaScript with the Phaser 3 spaceGame framework. This allows spaceGame mechanics and features to be implemented into a website generated with HTML and CSS.
                        As such the JetBrains Webstorm development environment was used to bring these systems together, providing an efficient workflow for implementing the spaceGame foundations and structure.
